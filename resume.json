    "summary": "Hi! I'm an aspiring fullstack developer experimenting with all kinds of technologies. My main focus lies on building foundations for maintainable and future-proof projects, incorporating the latest and greatest features that Javascript and the frontend ecosystem have to offer, always with a keen eye on performance and ease of use. Every great frontend needs a fast and reliable platform, so I've started dabbing into backend development and DevOps, building systems with serverless functions, Kubernetes, GraphQL and Prisma to scale easily and provide excellent developer experience. Also, I'm a design advocat and try to preach the importance of good user experience and design integrity whenever possible to build the best products.",
